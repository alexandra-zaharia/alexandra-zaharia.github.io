## Who am I?

Hi there! I'm a software engineer currently working in embedded systems. I hold a PhD degree in computer science. During my PhD I was a teaching assistant for first year Masters' students and found the whole experience very exciting. I'm passionate about problem solving and I view software development as craftsmanship. 

You can check out my [GitHub][] profile and my [resume](https://alexandra-zaharia.org){:target="_blank"} or you can connect with me on [LinkedIn][].

Outside of work I enjoy weightlifting and scuba diving <s>staying at home (COVID-19 edition)</s>, (my) cats, single player RPGs, sci-fi, coloring and many more. I love learning stuff, such as Spanish or drawing, and taking [scuba diving photos](https://www.ivresse-des-profondeurs.com/){:target="_blank"}.

My motto is:

> So much to learn... so little time!...

(The story of my life, literally.)

I can't stand people who take themselves too seriously.

## This blog
At the end of 2020 I decided to migrate some of my old posts from Blogspot and  Google Sites and start afresh with this beautiful Jekyll theme called [Chirpy][]. I started to slowly transform my pen-and-paper notes as well into blog posts. Being a bit OCD, I scrupulously respect the original date of an entry.

This place is a sort of  digital notebook where I jot things down. Even though I primarily intend it for my own use, I also strive to explain things clearly in the hope that other people might find value in these posts. Please feel free to engage in the comments :-) Ask away or criticize, this is what comments are for.
