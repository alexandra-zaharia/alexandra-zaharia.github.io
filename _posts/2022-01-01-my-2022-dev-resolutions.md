I'm working on improving my habits so I'll be writing yearly resolutions... starting today! This is what I'd like to achieve in 2022, professionally-wise:

## Soft skills

I need to focus more on **communicating in the corporate world** (might need to look into emotional intelligence and diplomacy). I'll also be continuing to **network** with like-minded people and to keep up-to-date with tech news.

## Personal brand

In 2021 I've managed to **blog somewhat consistently**, averaging one post every two weeks. This year I'd like to bring that average up to *one post per week*.

## Career

2021 was markedly **back-end focused** and I plan to keep it that way. In addition, I would like to get a wider exposure to **system design and architecture**. If all else fails, this might require to actually communicate with the DevOps team. :scream: I'll do my best.

## Work

I want to keep it **back-end focused**. And do some **tech demos** of those cool techs I'm tinkering with. This might even change a few ideas, who knows?

## Tech skills

*I'm just a soul whose intentions are good*, as the [song][] [goes][]:
* Dig deeper into back-end:
  * Build **REST APIs** with `flask`
  * Learn the **Go** programming language (and tech demo it!)
* Get a better understanding of **system design and architecture**
* Familiarize myself with **cloud computing**
* **Project**-wise, do the following for [Gal4xy][]:
  * Finish porting it from C to C++
  * Build multiplayer support using [Protocol Buffers][protobuf] and [gRPC][grpc]
  * Add a **Qt** GUI


## Conclusion

Whew, that's quite the list! :sweat_smile: I'll come back to review my progress in one year's time when I'll be doing the 2022 wrap-up. I'm both a bit nervous and a bit excited as it's the first time I'm doing this kind of exercise. *Everything's gonna be OK.*
